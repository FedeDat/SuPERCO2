# Electrochemical testing data

## Protocol

A protocol consisting of open circuit voltage (OCV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and chronoamperometry (CA) was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts under various electrochemical conditions.

* Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This measurement enables the quantification of the ohmic drop across the electrolyte (named ZIR) and thus to correct the resulting applied potential accordingly.
* Open Circuit Voltage (OCV). This measurement is recorded for the initial 30 minutes to determine the equilibrium potential of the system and assess the electrode stability.
* Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). CV experiments are carried out in Ar-saturated and CO2-saturated environments over a potential range of +0.5 to –1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Multiple scans (5 or 10, depending on the CV stability) are recorded to ensure reproducibility and to check for potential electrolyte impurities. The last CVs in both Ar- and CO2-saturated environments are compared to highlight potential windows where CO₂ reduction was most active
* Chronoamperometry (CA). Steady-state performance is assessed by polarizing the electrodes at fixed potentials for 30 minutes per step. The current density is recorded continuously, allowing for catalyst stability and efficiency to be evaluated during prolonged operation.

## Product analysis

The reaction products generated from eCO2R during the repeated chrono-amperometries were detected using gas and liquid sample analysis techniques to assess reaction selectivity and efficiency. Regarding gas analysis, the gaseous products, including CO, CH₄, and H₂, were collected from the cathode compartment and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC). Instead, with respect to liquid analysis, 1 mL of electrolyte was collected from the catholyte after each CA to assess the presence of liquid products, such as formate. These samples were stored in fridge and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentrations of these products were determined by comparing retention times and peak areas with those of standard solutions.

Typically, the concentrations of the different reaction products were obtained via the GC and the HPLC analyses. Then, the Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.) toward the different target products was calculated to assess the selectivity and activity of the catalysts. In fact, the Faradaic Efficiency represents the percentage of the total charge passed through the electrode that is utilized to form a specific reaction product. It serves as a comparative measure for evaluating the selectivity of different catalysts or reaction conditions.
