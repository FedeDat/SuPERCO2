# Methods - Energy Dispersive X-ray
To quantify the elemental composition of the sample, Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterization was performed via an in-house equipment (Oxford EDS microanalysis through a Si(Li) detector cooled with Liquid-N<sub>2</sub>).

# Methods - X-ray Diffraction
XRD measurements were carried out using an Empyrean Series III diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical) equipped with a HTK1200N high-temperature chamber (Anton Paar).
