# Equipment

* A Peristaltic Pump was used to control the flow rate during addition of the sodium hydroxide solutions.
* Magnetic stirrers were essential for ensuring uniform mixing of the reactants, thus they were employed whenever a solution was involved.
* A centrifuge was necessary for separating the precipitated particles from the reaction mixture



# Synthesis procedure

Synthesis carried out on 03/07/2024.

The synthesis of CuO was a simple water-based precipitation, followed by calcination (Table 1). 250 mL of milliQ water were added to 600 mg of copper chloride (CuCl2···2H2O) under vigorous magnetic stirring to achieve a 20 mM solution. Then a solution of 6 M NaOH was formed by mixing 12.1674 g of NaOH into a 50 mL volumetric flask. After this, half the NaOH solution (25 mL) was added to the copper chloride solution via the peristaltic pump with a fixed flow rate of 25 mL per minute. As soon as NaOH was inserted, a light blue copper hydroxide precipitate appeared (Figure 7). The precipitate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and cleaned with milliQ water. Four additional cleaning/centrifugation cycles were carried out, where the solvent was promptly removed. Then the resulting precipitate was transferred to a standard oven at 200 ºC for 2 hours where the hydroxide decomposed to CuO.
